/***********************************************************************************
* ircombine 0.1.1 - a log merger for irssi. This program reads in two
* irssi logfiles, and sorts them chronologically. This is useful 
* when, for example, you have two logfiles for the same person, 
* separated by an underscore: User and User_, or just somebody who 
* has a variety of names! It requires at least two arguments, the
* names of the two logfiles that you want to read, with an optional
* command to output the resultant log to a filename of your choosing
* (otherwise it'll default to ircombineOutput.log, and that's a really
* boring file name, not to mention a pretty useless one, so don't let
* this happen to you!
*
* This program is meant to compile with minimum dependencies; everything
* needed to run it should be found in the standard libraries and the
* included "logfile.h" header. Note that this program does require C++11
* to compile, otherwise you'll likely get an error stating that stoi() is
* not a member of std. This program has been tested with MinGW 4.8 and
* g++ 4.9.1. Let me know if you face any compilation issues, especially
* if you know how they might be solved!
*
* Problems with this program are, as mentioned, the fact that it doesn't take
* into account the possibility of custom irssi logs that don't use the same
* format that I do. I'm planning to fix this in later versions, I promise!
* Of course, if you have the inclination to do this yourself (and I don't
* doubt that there are many who could do a better job than I have) go ahead!
* There may also be issues with very large log files, edge cases definitely 
* need to be tested. This will, again, be addressed in future versions, hopefully.
*
* This software doesn't come with any kind of license; do with it what you will.
* I would ask that you strive to only use it for the betterment of others, and
* without any malice, but you're still free to use it if you can't satisfy those
* conditions. If you somehow manage to find a way to profit off of this software,
* congratulations! You aren't beholden to share your profits with me, or to even
* mention the use of this little piece of code in your project, although it would
* be appreciated. You are also free to modify this code however you please to suit
* your needs; in fact, I encourage you to do so! If you do make any improvements,
* please let me know! I welcome the opportunity to learn!
*
